                As the leading Docker training institute in Chennai, BITA
                Academy will provide you with comprehensive knowledge of the
                Docker Engine and its role as an application packaging platform.
                With a fundamental understanding of the command line and
                terminals, the Docker course is ideal for launching any web
                project. The Docker Course is accessible to individuals without
                prior knowledge of Docker or Kubernetes. Newcomers to the DevOps
                landscape, Docker and Kubernetes revolutionize the development
                and deployment of web applications. It would be advantageous to
                gain a deeper understanding of containers before manipulating
                them through basic Docker CLI commands. This course will teach
                you about Docker images, files, and containers. Developing an
                in-depth knowledge of Kubernetes can also facilitate the
                deployment of this cluster to Google Cloud, should you wish to
                construct an intricate multi-container application.

                Describe Docker
              </h2>

              <p className="p-2 text-sm text-textColor1">
                Docker lets developers install and manage apps in lightweight,
                separated containersâ€”open-source technology. Containers contain
                code, runtime, libraries, and system tools to run a program.
                Applications can function independently from the infrastructure
                using Docker's standardized and portable encoding mechanism. It
                streamlines development by reducing compatibility difficulties
                and ensuring software execution across development workstations,
                testing servers, and production servers. Docker streamlines
                developer collaboration and containerized application deployment
                while improving scalability and cooperation.

                    We know every client has a different schedule. Because of
                    this, we offer weekday, weekend, and online classes.
                    Students can choose a plan that meets their needs with this
                    flexibility.
