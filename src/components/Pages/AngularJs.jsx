              Describe Angular JS
              </h2>
              <p className="p-2 text-sm text-textColor1">
              Angular JS is a popular open-source web development framework. It was introduced in 2010 using JavaScript. Google updated this framework using TypeScript, a JavaScript superset. 
              Remember that AngularJS was not designed for mobile devices.
              </p>
              <p className="p-2 text-sm text-textColor1">
              Angular, a JavaScript framework, lets you build client-side apps with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. It adds if statements, loops, and local variables to HTML. Angular's complete data binding architecture lets us efficiently display fields from 
              our data model, monitor changes, and handle user updates.
