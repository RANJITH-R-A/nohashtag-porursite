              </h2>

              <p className="p-2 text-sm text-textColor1">
                Security testing is a method of software testing that safeguards
                an application against fraudulent intruder attacks by
                identifying its vulnerabilities, threats, and dangers. Security
                tests try to keep everyone in the company or people from outside
                the company from getting in without permission by finding any
                bugs or weak spots in the software that could cost money,
                information, or reputation.
